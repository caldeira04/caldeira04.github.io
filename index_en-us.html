            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is João Pedro Caldeira, I am 19 years old. Currently studying for a Bachelor's Degree on Analisys and Development of Systems on UniSenac Pelotas. I like a lot of the CS area in general and am specially fond for the front-end development area.</p>
            <p>In my GitHub, there are some small projects with simple scripts and algorithms that helped me on lame/repetitive tasks somehow.</p>
            <p>Beyond my studies, I like spending my free time playing games such as Counter Strike and Minecraft (specially extensive and focused on tech and automation), listening to all kinds of songs and occasionaly watching movies. As a "paid hobby", I like cleaning and building PCs aside from coding scripts that can make my life easier.</p>

            <h2>My qualifications</h2>
            <p>Having portuguese as my first language, learning english since very early was a must for me. In current days, I'm profficient on the language in basically any subject (be it related do computing or not)</p>
            <p>On my stack, I normally use Vue.js as my main framework, but React is not fully strange to me.</p>
            <p>On the front-end, after creating a page's design on Figma, I use HTML to build the page from the bottom up, optimizing its SEO and then styling it with pure, raw CSS, using technologies such as flexbox for resposiveness.</p>
            <p>Aside from these, I also have much experience with building and repairing desktops (diagnosing, part exchanging, complete builds, deep cleaning, etc), average knowledge on MS Office (specially Word and Excel) and writing documents in Markdown text language.</p>

            <h2>My projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>PádelSul Landing Page</li>
                <p>Wrote from the ground by me, from design to building, this page was an idea initially approved by a pádel club owner. Currently, it lacks responsiveness, animations to some elements and most of the pictures. As it's seen in the repo, the website was developed in Vue, for there's in the future the wish of integrating the landing page with the back-end of the club, controlling things such as empty hours and orders.</p>

                <li>Vue.js Padel/Tennis/Beach Tennis Counter</li>
                <p>Initially thought as a Vue State manipulation study, escalated into the creation of a full scoreboard with points, games, sets and even a tie-break counter, if needed. Currently, only works with 2 FT6 sets and using the golden point rule. Customization of the score limits is a future planned implementation.</p>

                <li>Python message builder</li>
                <p>Unrelating to my other projects, this Python script used to be my go-to message builder (when I still needed it). Essentially, what it does is: creating an array with all the available times of a day (inputted by the user). Then, it automatically detected the day time, greeted the "user", added a ready message (which could be picked off a list created by the user) and concatenated the available times.</p>
